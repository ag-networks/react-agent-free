## Database Architecture Overview

The Agent Free platform employs a polyglot persistence approach that leverages different database technologies optimized for specific use cases and access patterns. This architectural decision enables the platform to achieve optimal performance, scalability, and maintainability while supporting the diverse data requirements of a comprehensive real estate transaction management system.

The primary relational database serves as the foundation for transactional data that requires ACID properties and complex relationships. PostgreSQL is selected as the primary database engine due to its robust feature set, excellent performance characteristics, and strong support for JSON data types that enable flexible schema evolution. The relational database handles core entities such as users, properties, transactions, and contracts where data consistency and referential integrity are paramount.

Document-oriented storage is implemented using MongoDB for handling semi-structured and unstructured data such as property descriptions, contract templates, and user-generated content. This approach provides the flexibility needed to accommodate varying data structures while maintaining query performance and scalability. The document store is particularly well-suited for storing complex nested data structures that would be cumbersome to represent in traditional relational tables.

Time-series data storage is implemented using InfluxDB for handling high-volume, time-stamped data such as user activity logs, system performance metrics, and market data feeds. This specialized database provides optimized storage and query capabilities for temporal data that supports analytics and monitoring requirements.

Search and indexing capabilities are provided through Elasticsearch, which enables sophisticated full-text search across properties, documents, and communications. The search engine supports complex queries, faceted search, and real-time indexing that enhances user experience and system functionality.

Caching layers are implemented using Redis for session management, frequently accessed data, and real-time features such as notifications and live updates. The caching strategy reduces database load and improves response times for common operations.

## Core Entity Design

### Entity Relationship Principles

The database schema is designed around core business entities that reflect the real-world objects and relationships involved in real estate transactions. Each entity is carefully designed to maintain data integrity while providing the flexibility needed to accommodate various transaction types and business scenarios.

The schema implements normalized design principles where appropriate to eliminate data redundancy and maintain consistency, while also incorporating denormalization strategies for performance-critical queries and reporting requirements. Foreign key relationships are used to maintain referential integrity between related entities, with cascade rules that ensure data consistency during updates and deletions.

The design incorporates soft deletion patterns for entities that require audit trails and historical preservation. This approach maintains data integrity while enabling logical deletion of records that should no longer be active in the system. Soft deletion is particularly important for legal and compliance requirements in real estate transactions.

Temporal data patterns are implemented for entities that require historical tracking and versioning. This includes contract versions, property value changes, and user profile updates that need to maintain complete audit trails for legal and business purposes.

### Data Types and Constraints

The schema leverages PostgreSQL's rich data type system to ensure data accuracy and consistency. Appropriate data types are selected for each field based on the nature of the data and expected usage patterns. Numeric fields use precise decimal types for financial data to avoid floating-point precision issues that could affect transaction calculations.

Date and timestamp fields use timezone-aware data types to ensure accurate handling of dates and times across different geographic regions. This is particularly important for real estate transactions that may involve parties in different time zones and jurisdictions.

JSON and JSONB data types are used for flexible schema requirements where the structure may evolve over time or vary between records. This approach provides the benefits of schema flexibility while maintaining the query capabilities and performance characteristics of relational databases.

Check constraints and domain constraints are implemented to enforce business rules at the database level, ensuring data integrity regardless of the application layer. These constraints include validation of email formats, phone number formats, price ranges, and other business-specific rules.

## User Management Schema
